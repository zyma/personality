## Overview

A mockumentary-style series following the daily lives of office employees, where every MBTI type gets their moment to shine (or crash and burn spectacularly).

## Character Lineup

### Michael Scott (ENFP)
The well-meaning but chaotic boss who leads with heart over logic.
*"Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me."*

### Dwight Schrute (ESTJ)
The hyper-dedicated assistant who follows rules to an extreme.
*"In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear."*

### Jim Halpert (ENTP)
The prankster who uses wit to survive corporate monotony.
*"I'm just looking for an audience to laugh at my jokes."*

### Pam Beesly (ISFP)
The quiet artist trapped at reception, dreaming of more.
*"There's a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn't that kind of the point?"*

### Angela Martin (ISTJ)
The strict rule-follower who runs the Party Planning Committee with iron discipline.
*"I don't make the rules. I just enforce them."*
