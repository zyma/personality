---

INTJ: Mentally calculates the exact moment they can politely leave
INTP: Accidentally monologues about quantum physics for 20 minutes
ENTJ: Takes over the conversation and somehow closes a business deal
ENTP: Turns the awkwardness into comedy gold, date is charmed

INFJ: Already knew this would happen, prepared an escape route signal with a friend
INFP: Writing the sad poem about this in their head in real-time
ENFJ: Makes the other person feel so heard they forget the date is bad
ENFP: Suggests abandoning the restaurant for spontaneous adventure

ISTJ: Sticks it out politely but is definitely not calling back
ISFJ: Tries so hard to make it work they exhaust themselves
ESTJ: Gives honest feedback about how the date could be improved
ESFJ: Texting the group chat updates under the table

ISTP: "Accidentally" gets a work emergency call to escape
ISFP: Orders dessert anyway because art (the dessert) shouldn't suffer
ESTP: Flirts with the waiter just to see what happens
ESFP: Turns the disaster into a funny story they'll tell at parties forever
