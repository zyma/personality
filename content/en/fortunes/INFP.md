- Your daydream contains the seed of something real. Write it down.
- The world needs your softness today. Don't armor up.
- A small act of authenticity will ripple further than you expect.
- Your emotions are data. What are they telling you?
- Someone sees your depth. You're not too much.
- Today's healing comes from creating, not consuming.
- The story you're living is worth telling. Keep going.
