# About MBTI Wiki

MBTI Wiki is your comprehensive guide to understanding personality types through the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator framework.

## What is MBTI?

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a self-report questionnaire designed to indicate psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.

## Our Mission

We aim to make personality psychology accessible and engaging for everyone, helping you understand yourself and others better.

## The 16 Types

MBTI identifies 16 distinct personality types based on four dimensions:

- **Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I)** - Where you focus your attention
- **Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N)** - How you gather information
- **Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)** - How you make decisions
- **Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P)** - How you deal with the outside world
